# 🚀 ML-Project: Machine Learning & AI Engineering Portfolio

**Created by Ahmad Zaidan Al-Anshory**

Welcome to my central portfolio repository. This collection documents my journey in transitioning from traditional Data Science to full-stack **Machine Learning Engineering**.

Here, you will find independent projects where I explore end-to-end data solutions—moving beyond static Jupyter Notebooks to build interactive, deployed applications using modern frameworks like **FastAPI** and **Generative AI**.
